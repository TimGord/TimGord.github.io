Trying to squash <code>W</code> and widen <code>i</code> so that they have same width is at best inefficient and at worst less readable. And this is before we consider non-Western languages that use characters that are wider still.</p> <p>The convention that monospaced fonts are used for coding derives from programming\u2019s historical reliance on (a)\u00a0typewriter-like terminals and displays, and (b)\u00a0the ASCII character set (or similar), which can just about be crammed into a fixed width font.</p> <p>Typewriter habits</p> <p>\u2018Typewriter habits\u2019 is a term coined by Matthew Butterick in his excellent Practical Typography to describe bad typography habits left over from the typewriter era.</p> <p>The case for using proportional fonts for coding \u2013 essentially readability and efficiency \u2013 has already been well made by Mart\u0133n Storck, Nelson Minar and David Jonathan Ross.

In my experience, handling this issue is a combination of reviewing research to confirm that there is some stability to socio-economic type when moving home and getting comfortable that the liabilities for the young and old are not the material ones.</p> </li> <li> <p>It is tempting to incorporate ill health retirement indicators when analysing pensions in payment (if they are available), but, for many pension plans, the criteria for ill health retirement have been tightened up over time. This means, it may show up as predictive (in very large plans with sufficient data) but the time-based variation of the criteria may bias those predictions. I suggest testing including ill health indicators to see if the results are materially different, but regarding the model without ill health indicators as the robust one.</p> </li> <li> <p>The most common scenario of all for using mortality models is to value all of a pension plan\u2019s liabilities. But if pension is being used as a covariate then what should be used for current actives? It feels like at least some adjustment should be made to allow for potential future accrual to make them comparable to those of retirees. I don\u2019t think there is a single robust approach to this if you are using pension as a covariate.</p> </li> <li> <p>When trying to make pensions comparable over time, we need to consider what a pension represents. Is it (a)\u00a0a proxy for pay before retirement (and therefore correlated with other forms of wealth) or (b)\u00a0a proxy for total income during retirement? In the UK, this issue is usually elided because UK DB pensions are predominantly index-linked both before and after retirement. But in a pension systems where indexation of pensions in payment is less common, e.g. the USA, this may require attention. For instance, all else being equal, under interpretation\u00a0(a), a pension of \u00a310\u202f000\u00a0pa for a 75-year old that hasn\u2019t been increased since retirement implies a relatively more wealthy individual than the same pension for a 65-year old, whereas under interpretation\u00a0(b) no adjustment is required.
