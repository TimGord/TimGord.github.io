# Reprint policy

Thank you for your interest.

Feel free to republish items on this site provided you follow these guidelines:

1. Please

    - attribute me as the author, and
    - include a link to the original on this site.

2. Please do not maliciously construct an excerpt of a posting here that means something different when taken out of context.

3. If you republish something and someone sues you, itâ€™s not my problem.

It would be nice if you let me know what articles you are republishing and where, but I'll leave that to you.

Cheers
