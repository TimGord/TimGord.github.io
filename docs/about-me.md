# About me

I've been an actuary all my working life. It wasn't my original plan, but having run out of options at the end of my university degree, I assumed my second year room mate had done his research and followed him into the actuarial profession.

The work was fairly mundane until at Bacon & Woodrow (now Aon) I came into contact with [Andrew Smith](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-smith-2ab92a7/) in 1998 and then Jon Exley, from whom I learned that important aspects of finance had either been omitted from the actuarial syllabus or distorted in their presentation by -- what seemed to me at the time -- to be a reactionary profession. In an effort to address this, I spoke at sessional meetings, published papers and even ended up getting elected to the Council of the Institute of Actuaries. I was in good company with Andrew, Jon, [Cliff Speed](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cliff-speed-7a6011121/), [Charles Cowling](https://www.linkedin.com/in/charles-cowling-99639843/) and the evergreen [John Ralfe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-ralfe-19106829/) (who has summarised the times [here]( http://www.johnralfe.com/main_pages.php?page_num=16)).

For a short period, I was seconded to our investment team -- I assumed to help bring some of these ideas into practice -- but what was emerging, namely 'LDI', was a very long way away from what we had advocated.

I then did corporate actuarial consulting (before it was called that) and, given what I perceived to be a relatively complacent attitude to pension plan deficits, I raised awareness of [the importance of monitoring the pension plan sponsors' own financial condition](https://www.actuaries.org.uk/system/files/documents/pdf/sponsorcovenantrep.pdf).

After a break, I spent the 15 years to 2023, as head of what is now Demographic Horizons at Aon, focussing on forecasting pensioner longevity for defined benefit pension plans. Along the way, I advised on the largest longevity transactions in the UK, the US and continental Europe and chaired the UK's [Continuous Mortality Investigation](https://www.actuaries.org.uk/learn-and-develop/continuous-mortality-investigation) and, in particular, its Mortality Projections Committee. (If you're interested in a little more detail, see [this LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/leaving-aon-demographic-horizons-tim-gordon-3josc).)

I'm currently working on some things I've wanted to do for a long time but not had the chance.
