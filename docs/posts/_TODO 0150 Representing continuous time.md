Quantisation

Ironically, important to implement as integers to avoid the vagaries of floating point arithmetic. Floating point is neither *precise* -- the evaluation of *a*&#x202F;+&#x202F;*bc* depends on which machine instructions are used -- nor *associative* -- the result of (*a*&#x202F;+&#x202F;*b*&#x202F;)+*&#x202F;c* often differs from *a*&#x202F;+&#x202F;(*b*&#x202F;+*&#x202F;c*), sometimes with catastrophically so.
